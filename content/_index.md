Hey, there! I'm Hemish. My pronouns are [he/him]. I am an organized mess of some random molecules existing to form something called 'life' in human form. This life was born in [Haryana], [India] and this life is currently 17 years old (though according to science, almost all my cells have been replaced by new cells, so am I me even?).

The neurons in my brain are very crazy about logical stuff.
```I do computers and linux.``` I like programming and testing out random stuff on Linux.

I contribute to Hindi language translations in open source projects, thus making computers and software accessible to larger masses, and I am part of [Indlinux hindi team].

I use [GNOME apps] (if you change language to Hindi on this page, what you see is also translated by me) and [hyprland] on my desktop which runs on [Arch Linux].

I regularly read and contribute to [Wikipedia], thus making information accessible.

I belive that knowledge and information should be accessible to people, more than it was accessible to me, because knowledge is what empowers one.

All my contributions to software, translations, and Wikipedia are listed at [contributions].

I also like to learn languages, be it human or computer ones. The languages I know both to read and write are [English], [Hindi], [Punjabi] ([gurmukhi]). I am learning [Spanish]. One of language I know little and can only speak is [Saraiki] (Multani dialect).

I [write poems] in English, Hindi and Punjabi. (who knows I would start writing in Spanish too)

I write about anything mentioned above in [my posts]. My posts are categorised into different [tags]. If you use some application or website for feeds, you can load my feed into that to never miss my posts. If you do not want to see all posts and want to follow a particular topic only, that is possible, separate RSS feeds are also listed at [tags]. Alternatively, you can also subscribe to [newsletter] to get an email whenever I make a new post.
