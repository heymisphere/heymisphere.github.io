		<title>Appreciation post for my sister</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Though we have an age gap of about 6 years, I still kinda think that we enjoyed a similar kind of childhood, dispered by some differences as well. &lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; 
Growing up with a sibling is kind of fun, and annoying at same time. You get to experience some of same things, you learn some things together, or maybe sometimes do fun stuff together (yeah referring to friendly fights, or maybe my sister randomly dressing me up as a girl!). Even dispersed by 6 years, I still want to say that I just always felt us to be the same age.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been times I have disappointed my sister or caused discomfort to her, knowing or unknowingly, and same applies to her, but at the end of the day, you are siblings who are bound to be kinda share things with each other even after you grow up and make your own individual lives, or in parents&#x27; words &amp;quot;live together the whole lives&amp;quot; (yes referring to the times when parents randomly ask us to sing that &#x27;ek hazaaron mein meri&#x2F;mera behna&#x2F;bhai hai, saaaariiiiii umarrrrrr hummeeeee sung rehnaaa haii&#x27; on birthdays or Raksha Bandhan).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get to know about someone more when you discuss insightful topics with them, or just have mature conversations. Maybe I was just too childish at that time for us to have mature conversations. But, as now I have grown into an adolescent, maybe I am able to talk maturely, and the age gap seems less powerful. As far as I remember, we only just shared regular sibling stuff with each other, nothing much. But in recent years, I just feel we have bonded more, we share more stuff with each other (some of which is not to be told to parents), we text each other randomly, and blah blah lots of stuff. This kind of connection is recent, maybe it has some potential reasons behind it. One major potential reason could be that I just am now more mature (as in age) that she shares stuff with me and confides in me. Second potential reason could be that we spend kinda the entire COVID lockdown in same room, and that contributed to the bonding. Whatever the reason be, I am just content and happy that we share a healthy bond.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, we kind of had fun with each other, but didnt talk about educational or other stuff much, she just use to help me with projects (yeah the elder siblings have to do that). We always hear on TV or on Internet, that when asked to people in their interviews &amp;quot;Who is your idol?&amp;quot;, it is a common pattern for people to tell their idol to be their elder sibling. But, in childhood, that was not the case with me, I always thought I achieve more good ranks or marks in classes, then she did when she was in same class, or even other things. So I always kind of felt her to be below me, but I was WRONG. You get to realise stuff when you grow mature. From listening to her advances on Twitter, LinkedIn, freelances and then finally at &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;tal64&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Tal64&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (literally she told me bits of funny stuff about freelances, their clients at Tal64, or maybe even about &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;vyombh&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Vyom Bhatia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) , I was always happy for her in my mind &amp;quot;She is doing good, she is making great progress&amp;quot;. Though, I would not use the word &#x27;idol&#x27; (because that word is highly idolised), I can say that I certainly do take inspiration from her and her progress and I can say &#x27;Slayyyyy Bitch!&#x27; to her.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, she brought me to Twitter and LinkedIn (ugh I want a word between &#x27;forced&#x27; and &#x27;brought me to&#x27;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlast, Happy Birthday Chelsi! (and yas I now tend to omit &#x27;Didi&#x27; word which our parents and family have made us to use)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Weird trend in school</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How can bringing thread into school almost become illegal? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, something like this actually happened in Grade 5 in our school.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I remember, a girl (obviously not going to reveal her name) knew some catscradle tricks (making figures with hands and threads, Nobita in Doraemon anime also knows that) and taught some of her friends about it and this got popularised within the girls, and girls who talked with guys popularised it to some guys and soon it spread to half of guys of class (because half of guys were reluctant). People learnt stuff like Eiffel tower and other things from YouTube and some desi catscradle from people around us which were not on internet. Everyone taught each other any new tricks, and this reached to such a level that students started bringing whole thread rolls in school, and when teachers used to teach, they used to catscradle while hiding their hands under benches. As teacher noticed distracted focus, teachers started snatching threads during class, and it almost became illegal to bring threads (I myself got my thread snatched by bus conductor (it started to go out of class via people who had friends in same locality who shared same school bus, and as school bus journey was 20-30 minutes, people did in buses too)). So in that batch and section of ours, it almost became illegal to bring threads rolls (those which are generally used in home sewing machines in South Asia).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: When I told this in some group of friends, some acknowledged that it also got popular in their section, so it almost spread to entire class of ours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Upgrading firmware in Linux using fwupd</title>
		<published>2022-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Want to upgrade your PC or laptop&#x27;s firmware but don&#x27;t want to use Windows?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;fwupd&quot;&gt;Fwupd&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a command line program, which has the ability to fetch firmware updates from vendors (including proprietary vendors like Dell) and apply the updates.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it worked seamlessly with my Dell Latitude 5490 and a HGST brand hard drive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to just enable the &lt;code&gt;fwupd.service&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; through systemd, and then you would be able to operate the application using the command line.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some GUI front ends available for the same application like gnome-firmware. Even &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ubuntu.com&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is developing a flutter based frontend for it. But, for me, command line works best.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s just wonderful to see that we have reached a point, where every other thing doesn&#x27;t require Windows, and we can daily drive Linux on our laptops and computers. That&#x27;s the power of opensource community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Hamara Plymouth Theme</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamara Linux&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was&#x2F;is a India based linux distribution. It is in pretty dormant stage now (Even the site is down for some time).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsmeh.com&#x2F;chirag_sukhala&quot;&gt;Chirag Sukhala&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; what is even the need of such a Linux distribution which gives you Indic languages preinstalled when you can just install Indic languages in pretty much any popular linux distro &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I would have to dig into archives to extract wallpapers from their ISO, but I found that their Plymouth theme (Plymouth is a program installed by many distros to give you a boot animation) is in Debian repositories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an Arch Linux user, I created a PKGBUILD and an &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aur.archlinux.org&quot;&gt;AUR&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Arch Linux User Repository) package for it. It is called &#x27;plymouth-theme-hamara&#x27;. So, now any Arch Linux user can enjoy that boot animation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the package here: &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aur.archlinux.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;plymouth-theme-hamara&quot;&gt;plymouth-theme-hamara&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Translating in open-source world</title>
		<published>2022-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Isn&#x27;t it amazing to get your credits in an opensource app?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;dialect-credits.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing credits in app called Dialect&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dialect is an open-source desktop translation app for linux systems, specifically designed for GNOME desktop. I translated it into Hindi so that anyone using their desktop in Hindi may be able to see Hindi translations and the app doesnt look like an odd English app in hindi environment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source is not only about code, it&#x27;s about multi-faceted work loads spread across community , to which everyone contributes in their own time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this includes translation as well. We live in a globalised world, so people across different nations, speaking different languages use computers, so internationalization (i18n) and localisation (l10n) of apps is important.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I belive having access to computers is a basic right for everyone, and whatever I can do for making computers more accessible is worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I am part of hindi translation team at &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;l10n.gnome.org&quot;&gt;l10n.gnome.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (and I have translated stuff like gnome-clocks, gnome-weather, gnome-bluetooth, gnome-characters). The official website of our team is &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indlinux.org&quot;&gt;indlinux.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Mitmproxy</title>
		<published>2022-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I came across this wonderful tool called &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitmproxy.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;mitmproxy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which is a TLS capable HTTP and HTTPS proxy and can be used by pen-testers and enthusiasts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their documentation provides an easy way to install CA trust certificates on each operating system so that browser or any application does not show security errors making it unable to connect to required site.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides three tools in single package:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mitmdump: This is a CLI tool which can be used to dump http(s) requests. It is like tcpdump tool, but just for HTTP and capable of decoding TLS requests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mitmproxy: This is a TUI interface which provides convenient way of monitoring the requests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mitmweb: is a web interface (the interface is rendered in your browser) which provides a chromium-devtools-like interface for monitoring and editing requests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitmweb is most convenient as it provides a GUI interface. Though, BurpSuite may be beneficial for advance usecases; but for a random hobbyist, mitmproxy is enough for just intercepting requests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
